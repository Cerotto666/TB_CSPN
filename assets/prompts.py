Topic Ontology to use:
["availability","latency","auth","database","network","config","capacity",

Analysis hints:
- Map impact {{1,2,3}} -> {{"high","medium","low"}} as impact_label.
- service: keep as lower-kebab (e.g., "user-service", "order-api").
- state: one of {{"new","in progress","resolved","closed"}} (lowercase).

STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a single flat JSON object that maps topic names to scores in [0,1], no other keys, no prose, no markdown.
Example:
{{"availability": 0.92, "incident_management": 0.80}}

Do NOT include any extra fields (e.g., "proposed_topics", "summary", "route", etc.). If you think no topics apply, return {{}}.
